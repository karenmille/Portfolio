                                <p class="center">Javascript is the de facto language of the web, meaning your browser has it,
                                     and you can do all sorts of stuff to/in your browser without the pain of setting up 
                                     environments and code editors, downloading compilers and learning how to use them and what not. 
                                     This makes it the biggest reason why one should learn Javascript.</p>
                                <p class="center">JavaScript is not a very complicated language at its core. It can seem difficult to 
                                    learn because of all of the noise around it. Browser APIs, Library APIs, jQuery, React, TypeScript, 
                                    the many npm packages out there, etc all can make the language syntax space seem huge. And this 
                                    isn’t helped by the fact that the language has evolved over time so you’ll see many different ways 
                                    to do a single task spread out over the internet. But the core language and standard libraries are 
                                    actually pretty small compared to languages like Python and Java that have more features and larger 
                                    standard libraries. Eventually you’ll need the ecosystem. But knowing the core language features that
                                     are implemented in most browsers is a great start.</p>
                                <p class="center">Becoming better at JavaScript is a great goal, and one that all web developers should 
                                    continually strive to accomplish. In order to meet this goal, it can be helpful to be strategic about
                                     what you wish to accomplish and learn. I have found that it’s important to remember my reason for
                                      wanting to become better at JavaScript. This allows I have to re-visit my why if I get stuck, and 
                                      it can be a powerful way to stay motivated. With that in mind, I learn a process that I can use.
                                       It is a very general framework, which I hope will allow me to plug in my goals and keep moving 
                                       forward</p>
                                <p class="center">Now that I have a better grasp on how scope and this works in JavaScript, if in any 
                                    respect possible, I try to keep away from creating variables and functions on the worldwide scope. 
                                    This is one of the simplest, however often unnoticed, debugging and performance upgrades you can do
                                     to any app</p>
                                <p class="center">When developing JavaScript, its important to be able to debug problems and understand 
                                    how existing systems work. It is a good idea that as a JavaScript developer to I get accustomed to 
                                    browser devtools as much as you can. Every browser provides them and they differ in some regards, 
                                    but they all give you a lot of insight. I want to learn what’s available to me by inspecting objects 
                                    the browser gives you in the console. Learning better what happens when my page gets rendered and where
                                     the bottlenecks are. I can inspect, edit and test what the visual output of your code is and see the 
                                     CSS browsers generate from it.</p>
                                <p class="center">As you go through this process, you will get better and better at figuring out what is
                                     missing from your JS education. You will be familiar at this point with the courses and resources
                                      that will be the most helpful to you. You can then continue to gain the skills and knowledge you 
                                      need until my goal is met.</p>
                                <p class="center">It's important to keep in mind that frameworks and libraries come and go. As someone
                                     said to me before, more JS frameworks are born every day than there are people. I want to focus on 
                                     first having a good understanding of the language itself rather than going straight into fancy frameworks
                                      like Angular or React.</p>
                                <p class="center">To Learn about specific features of JS that usually cause confusion to people coming from 
                                    other languages, like how the "this" keyword actually works, closures, the prototype chain and the event 
                                    loop. Learning object-oriented patterns in JavaScript is also very useful. I think this is a very good
                                     place to start. </p>
                                <p class="center">I realize that my answer is somewhat general; however, with a subject as vast as JavaScript,
                                     I think that it is helpful to be strategic about what it is that I want to accomplish. Otherwise, it’s all
                                      too easy to get sidetracked. You could spend the next 10 years alone learning JS frameworks! I will become 
                                      better at JavaScript, yes, but spending time on subjects within JS that won’t further my goals won’t be a
                                       great use of my time. So, that’s why I plan to be strategic and determined, continue to take an honest 
                                       assessment of my skills, and re-visit my reason for wanting to become better at JS if / when I get stuck.</p>
